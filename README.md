Fork of https://github.com/elm/compiler

IMPORTANT: You can no longer compile this branch directly, because I replaced the auto-generated `Paths_elm` with `Paths_ulm` that is used by the parent `ulm-wasm` compiler repo.

If you want to build the wasm binaries, you need to switch to the branch [main-wasm](https://github.com/marc136/elm-compiler-wasm/tree/main-wasm) instead.\
I just keep this branch as the "main" one to keep track of the [upstream Elm compiler repository](https://github.com/elm/compiler).
